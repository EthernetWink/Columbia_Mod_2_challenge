# Columbia_Mod_2_challenge

This file contains my submission for the Module 2 challenge.
The objective we had was to get a filtered list of loans based off user input being checked against a list of banks and their rates and thresholds.

Then with those loans we would either export them to a new csv or not depending on the users wishes.

The use of Fire and Questionary is there as well as per requirements.

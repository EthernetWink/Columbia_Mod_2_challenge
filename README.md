# Columbia_Mod_2_challenge

This file contains my submission for the Module 2 challenge.
The objective we had was to get a filtered list of loans based off user input being checked against a list of banks and their rates and thresholds.

Then with those loans we would either export them to a new csv or not depending on the users wishes.

The use of Fire and Questionary is there as well as per requirements.

# Usage

For this program the user starts by specifying which csv to get the bank and rate data from.
Next the user inputs their credit score, monthly debt, monthly income, desired loan amount, and current home value.
Then we get a list of loans the quailfy for, or we don't depending on thier credentials.

If we do get a list we ask the user if they want to store it in a csv or if we don't quailify for a loan we just exit.
If the user opts to not have the results output to a csv the program exits.

# TXT file

a history of terminal ocnversation

# Daily rate sheet

That CSV file was the one used in making and running this repo
